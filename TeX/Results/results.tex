\chapter{Results}
In this chapter results of both simulations are compared and presented as graphs of velocity components and turbulent quantities along lines $x=0.2$ (figures \ref{fig::ux2} - \ref{fig::nut2}) and $x=0.2$ (figures \ref{fig::ux15} - \ref{fig::nut15}) .
The first sampling line is located \SI{0,1}{\meter} past the inlet to the trimmed domain (and \SI{0,2}{\meter} from flat plate starting point, see figure \ref{fig::flatplate}). The second one is located near the outlet of both domains.
