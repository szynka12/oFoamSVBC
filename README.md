# oFoamSVBC
Repository containing two open foam cases:
1. flatPlate - turbulent flow over a flat plate modelled after Ercoftac T3A case
2. trimmedFlatPlate - same flow as in the above case, domain is trimmed and space-varying boundary conditions are imposed.
Obtained results are compared to results from original domain.

OpenFOAM usage along with influence of boundary conditions is described in ,,Utilisation of space-varying boundaryconditions in OpenFOAM numerical package'' (./TeX/main.pdf).
