# oFoamSVBC
Repository containing two open foam cases:
1. flatPlate - turbulent flow over a flat plate
2. trimmedFlatPlate - same flow as in the above case, domain is trimmed and space-varying boundary conditions are imposed.

They are described in ,,Utilisation of space-varying boundaryconditions in OpenFOAM numerical package''.
